# **Real-Time Public Transport Tracking System**

## **Project Summary**  
Commuting in crowded cities can be stressful due to unreliable public transport schedules and limited information on vehicle arrival times. This project introduces a real-time public transport tracking system aimed at improving the commuting experience for bus and train users. 

### **Key Features**:
- **Real-Time Location Tracking:** View live locations of buses and trains on a map.
- **Crowd Level Prediction:** Get predictions on how crowded each transport option will be using machine learning.
- **Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA):** Accurate ETAs based on real-time speeds and traffic conditions.
- **Operational Vehicles Display:** See the number of buses or trains operating on specific routes.
- **User Feedback Integration:** Contribute to the system by providing feedback on crowdedness, enhancing prediction accuracy over time.

By leveraging GPS data, machine learning, and user feedback, the system aims to provide accurate, real-time information, helping users make informed travel decisions and reducing commuting stress.
